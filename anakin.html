            <h1>Young Anakin Skywalker</h1>
            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p><em>"Had he been born in the Republic, we would have identified him early. The Force is unusually strong
                    with
                    him, that much is clear. Who was his father?"
                    "There was no father. I carried him, I gave birth, I raised him, I can't explain what
                    happened."</em><br />â€•Qui-Gon Jinn and Shmi Skywalker</p>

            <div class="grid-container">
                <div>
                    <p>Believed to have been conceived by the midi-chlorians,Anakin Skywalker was born to the slave
                        Shmi Skywalker.Although Skywalker was listed as born on the desert planet of Tatooine, a
                        holographic log stated that Shmi and he moved to the planet when Skywalker was at a very young
                        age.
                        Regardless, Tatooine was Skywalker's homeworld. Skywalker and his mother were originally
                        owned by Gardulla the Hutt until she lost them to the Toydarian Watto in a podracing bet when
                        Skywalker was around age 3. Affectionately nicknamed "Ani," he worked in his master's shop,
                        located
                        in Mos Espa.</p>

            <p>Even at a young age, Skywalker exhibited exceptional piloting skills, and built the protocol droid C-3PO,
                specially modified to withstand
                Tatooine's sand and heat[27] for his mother.[11] Once, while he was working in Watto's scrapyard,
                he found a broken servomotor which he thought he could repair and use on the droid that he was
                building and asked his master for it. With a glance, Watto saw that it was worthless and grunted
                that he could, but as Skywalker walked away, Watto told him nothing was free and had him work harder
                the next day.[27] On one occasion, Skywalker and his mother were lost in a sandstorm, but the boy
                refused to listen to her when she demanded he return home if he could see it. Unwilling to leave her
                behind, he trekked through the storm to reach her, promising her that they would be fine and that he
                would not leave her</p>

                    <p>Skywalker got the photoreceptors for the droid at a market in Mos Espa. Though a Gran wanted them
                        too
                        and chased him through the market, Skywalker escaped by destroying an Ithorian's stall and
                        blocking
                        the Gran's pursuit.[29] Before he had even turned nine, Skywalker's work had ensured 3PO was
                        operational.[30] He was close friends with fellow slaves Kitster Banai and Wald, as well as the
                        elderly Jira. He also built his own podracer, which would eventually help him win a podracing
                        contest</p>
                    <p>Over the course of his life on Tatooine, Skywalker never saw it rain.[31] At some
                        point, Watto told Anakin to go and throw away some scrap. When looking at it,
                        Anakin found an ultra power cell, just what he needed for his pod. Suddenly, a
                        swoop gang with a Devaronian member attacked the streets and shot the generator
                        for the medical center. When Anakin examined it to see if he could repair the
                        generator he saw that it needed a power cell. So, he took his power cell and
                        saved the medical center. A week later, Anakin participated in a pod race with
                        Sebulba who made him lose by cheating. Anakin stated that if he would have used
                        the power cell on his own pod, he would have won but it was more important for
                        the medical center to receive it</p>
