            <h1>DARTH VADER</h1>
            <p>Once the heroic Jedi Knight named Anakin Skywalker, Darth Vader was seduced by the dark side of the
                Force.
                Forever scarred by his defeat on Mustafar, Vader was transformed into a cybernetically-enhanced Sith
                Lord.
                At the dawn of the Empire, Vader led the Empire’s eradication of the Jedi Order and the search for
                survivors. He remained in service of the Emperor -- the evil Darth Sidious -- for decades, enforcing his
                Master’s will and seeking to crush the Rebel Alliance and other detractors. But there was still good in
                him…
            </p>
            <h2>Anakin Skywalker</h2>
            <p>Anakin Skywalker was a legendary Force-sensitive human male who was a Jedi Knight of the Galactic
                Republic
                and the prophesied Chosen One of the Jedi Order, destined to bring balance to the Force. Also known as
                "Ani"
                during his childhood, Skywalker earned the moniker "Hero With No Fear" from his accomplishments in the
                Clone
                Wars. His alter ego, Darth Vader, the Dark Lord of the Sith, was created when Skywalker turned to the
                dark
                side of the Force, pledging his allegiance to the Sith Lord Darth Sidious at the end of the Republic
                Era.
